## Project Nameplate
Over the course of the past month, me and my fellow innovators have learned and explored new tools and new methods to designing and creating, I have created this page to display some of the things that I have created over the course of project nameplate.

When designating roles for making the nameplates I signed myself up for the mock up team. Me and my partner went through multiple designs, testing and changing over and over again until we felt comfortable bringing a piece of work to the class. Below I will list display a few of the designs that I have created.
